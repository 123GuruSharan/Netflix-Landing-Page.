# Netflix-Landing-Page.
This project is a Netflix homepage clone using HTML and CSS, featuring a header with navigation, a call-to-action, a feature showcase, and an accordion-style FAQ section. The footer offers essential links and a language option for accessibility. Responsive and provides a hands-on approach to modern web design and layout techniques.
